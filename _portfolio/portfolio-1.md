* Statement of Intellectual Development
As I conclude my sixteenth year at Duke University and reflect on my work across the last five years of my appointment in the Program in Education, several areas of professional growth in scholarship, teaching, and service emerge.

* Scholarship 
Over the last five years, I have written 6 grants seeking support to further my investigation in the areas of educational policy, curriculum development, and underserved gifted students.  Grants were submitted to both federal (Institute for Education Sciences; Library of Congress) and private sources (Spencer Foundation, W.T. Grant Foundation).  To date, none have been funded, but one grant submitted to the Institute for Education Sciences ($1.39 million) is pending with a decision expected by  July 2017.  In collaboration with William Darity (Duke) and Monique McMillian (Morgan State), a letter of interest to investigate the policy implications of income-based school assignment policies is being sent to the W. T. Grant Foundation this summer. 
In the summer of 2016, I assumed the role of Principal Investigator on two National Science Foundation grants administered by the Program in Education.  One of the grants ($789,374) supports scholarships and mentoring activities for Duke's MAT students pursuing math and science teaching opportunities in high-needs schools. The other grant ($299,967) supports the exploration of launching a Middle Grades MAT program in math and science. Proposals requesting a continuation of funding for these two programs are underway and will be submitted to the National Science Foundation in Fall 2017. 
Since 2012, I have completed several major writing projects. I have co-authored one book and 6 book chapters, co-edited a major introductory text in curriculum design in gifted education and co-edited 4 texts for a successful series.  I have also presented at 9 state and national conferences on topics ranging from best practices in instructional pedagogy to the psychology of the gifted student.

* Teaching 
The use of technology to enhance instruction continues to be a focus across all the courses that I teach.  In 2016, I once again taught an online course for undergraduates (EDUC 241), which consisted of synchronous class meetings using WebEx as well as asynchronous course assignments housed within Sakai. This summer class affords students the opportunity to enroll in Duke classes regardless of where they are during the summer.  A similar delivery format was offered to teachers in Davidson and Rockingham Counties who were enrolled in the gifted education licensure program. 
Offering coursework in an alternative format has required that I make modifications to the ways I might typically present content in a more traditional classroom environment.  As such, I have found that many of the transformed methods have resulted in better (more refined) learning experiences, thus I have started to embed these revised approaches even within my traditional, face-to-face classes.  My growing knowledge of PebblePad, a new e-portfolio system that Duke will be launching campus-wide in 2017-18, continues to provide me with additional ideas as to how I can further enhance student learning in my courses by incorporating collaborative experiences within a virtual context.    
In addition to the incorporation of technology, I continue to enhance my approach to teaching by placing additional emphasis on the examination of exemplars and non-exemplars of course assignments, the authentic modeling of instructional models introduced in methods coursework (i.e., Problem-Based Learning, Socratic Seminar, Taba’s Concept Development, Bruner’s Structure of the Discipline, Visual Thinking Strategies, Kohlberg’s Moral Dilemmas, etc.), the embedding of peer coaching/mentoring strategies within clinical experiences, and timely and comprehensive feedback on all course assignments. 
Another instructional support method that I have been building into all of my classes is the use of graphic organizers.  I have found that such organizers help students thoroughly analyze and synthesize the concepts discussed in class to ensure they move beyond a basic familiarity to an in-depth understanding of course content. 
Other course enhancements include “field trips” to the Nasher Museum and Perkins Library and guest speakers. At the Nasher, students engage in a workshop led by the education curator. At Perkins, the education librarian provides a workshop for accessing research materials through Duke’s library system.  Guest speakers have included Eric Oakley, a Ph.D. candidate in History at UNCG who is an expert in developing and implementing simulations in the K-12 classroom and in-service/retired teachers who have shared their expertise with undergraduates.

* Service
Over the last five years, education has experienced a dearth of  policy changes related to teacher preparation.  These changes have a direct impact on both our curriculum and internal policies and procedures. As accreditation coordinator and licensure officer for our teacher preparation programs, I have closely monitored these policy shifts to ensure our programs remain in compliance with directed mandates.  The enactment of new licensure tests, clinical practice requirements, mentor teacher qualifications, and program review processes  is often challenging to navigate, but I have successfully led efforts to ensure Duke's teacher preparation programs are in compliance with NC law and meet national accreditation standards. 
I have served and continue to serve on several university committees  (Committee on Assessment of Educational and       Administrative Support, Arts & Sciences Faculty Assessment Committee, Online Courses Faculty Assessment Committee).  Work on these committees has allowed me to meet other faculty and staff across campus and has given me insight that has been helpful for the Program in Education's own strategic planning. 
In my role as co-director of the Educational Policy Working Group within Duke's Samuel Dubois Cook Center on Social Equity, I have coordinated film screenings, panel discussions, and brown bag lunches on a variety of issues pertaining to educational equity.  These events have helped support constructive dialogue among students, faculty, and community members around critical social issues. 
In 2016, I also became a faculty mentor for PebblePad. In this role I assist other faculty and departments (School of Nursing; Kenan Institute for Ethics; Art, Art History, and Visual Studies; Duke Global Health Institute) as they begin thinking about the possible uses of ePortfolio systems in their courses and programs. 

* Concluding Thoughts
A central premise of Duke’s teacher preparation programs is to help pre-service teachers understand the value of regular and purposeful reflection. This review process has further demonstrated to me the importance of such strategic reflection. While I have always been uncomfortable extolling my own accomplishments, I have come to realize that acknowledgment of one’s achievements is a central component of the reappointment and promotion process, and academia in general. 
Compiling this dossier has served to illuminate the direction and focus my work has taken and will certainly help me as I develop my future professional goals.
I hope this compilation of evidence portraying my work for the past five years at Duke University serves not only as a summative assessment of my achievements, but that it also communicates the professional growth I have exhibited during my faculty appointment in the Program in Education.
