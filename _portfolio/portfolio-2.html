* Teaching and Learning objectives
Self-reflective statement about my teaching philosophy, including your goals, objectives and methods.
I have always loved learning. My favourite classroom memories are of arriving with no
expectation and an empty mind, and then sparked by the enthusiasm of an engaging teacher,
leaving thirsting for further information. In fact, I am addicted to learning. Not only do I want
to engage students in fascinating aspects of my discipline but I also want to instil a desire for
lifelong learning. This narrative describes my teaching philosophy to undergraduate and
Honours students, the journey I have embarked on with the scholarship of teaching and
learning, as well as some of the challenges I have faced. Reflecting on my path, the narrative
concludes with the goals that I want to achieve as a teacher by making a difference, cultivating
in students some values, qualities and characteristics to carry with them through life so they
can contribute meaningfully to society. The evidence of examples included in the reflective
narrative is organised in six appendices following References: Appendix A: Teaching
philosophy (p20), Appendix B: Module development (p22), Appendix C: Teaching and
learning activities and artefacts (p27), Appendix D: Industry interaction (p39), Appendix E:
Student feedback (p40) and Appendix F: Student success (p44)

  *Teaching philosophy
I follow the same approach to students as I have for others: respect them as individuals;
today’s students are not the same as I was, having a different experiential skill set and
educational upbringing, often facing different, harder challenges. Something important for me
to remind myself is; why would my students care about what I have to say if I don’t care about
them in their context? Their success here at the university is my success, consequently their
results are important to me; hence, I let students know that I want them to learn and to
succeed as recommended by this quote from John Wooden, one of the most revered coaches
in the history of sports:
“Seek opportunities to show you care. The smallest gestures often make the biggest difference.”
However, students have to realize that they are ultimately responsible for their own learning
experience so they can become self-directed learners (Rashid & Asghar 2016) conscious of
their own thinking processes.
My belief is that students learn best when they actively construct knowledge in relation to what
they already know (Brampton 2012; DiBiase 2018) and if they are adequately motivated (Xie
& Reider 2014). Failure to have mastered core concepts undermines a student’s ability to
advance understanding of new knowledge (Brampton 2012). Every year there are new
students, bringing with them a new learning context. My modules must be therefore be 
adaptable to the needs of the particular student group, connecting new information to accurate
information they already possess, providing a balance between support and challenge
(Cordingley et al. 2015).
It is important for students to learn how, and where, to find the right information they need
and then how to apply this to real world problems. As one only really starts unpacking what
one has learnt in the workplace, exposure to self-study and research is imperative. The best
type of learning is through experience and the concept of peer learning within a learning
community (Gaffney et al. 2008; DeMers 2010) can provide this opportunity. I endeavour
to expand the learning spaces so that it better approximates what happens outside the
classroom (Branch 2018).
