Hi everyone!

My name is Azeez Adeboye (PhD Biostatistics). 

Azeez Adeboye is a computational Biostatistician and Data scientist at the University of Fort Hare, Alice, South Africa. His reseach focuses on modelling diseases' prevention and control. Highly interested in the areas of research on Applied and Mathematical statistics, infectious diseases, environmental and surveillance statistics, public health, bioinformatics, project management and strategy implementation in various statistical manners.

His is an R enthusiast currently working on developing my 2nd package. His R programming journey began in 2014 when he was told to run an R script to “simulate and analyze some data”. Having never programmed before at that time he was overwhelmed. But he took on the challenge and soon realized the power and joy of programming. Since then he learned a couple of other programming languages including MATLAB, Python and SAS. But his favorite is still by far R. He enjoy sharing his knowledge and started doing so publicly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/azizadeboye) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCegCQv-GYjGrHOD3H3_5weQ) in late 2019.

This blog focuses predominantly on R but will cover others occasionally. He enjoys data visualization a lot so you’ll likely find some posts on that, too. Finally, if you don’t enjoy reading that much but would like to watch me code you can do so on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCegCQv-GYjGrHOD3H3_5weQ). See you there!
