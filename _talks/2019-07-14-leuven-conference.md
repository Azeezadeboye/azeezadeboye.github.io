Context
In medical researches, different types of longitudinal responses of binary, continuous and ordinal may be collected from the same patients with hypertension. High blood pressure is a chronic disease and major health challenge over many decades due to its contributions to the global health concern. Hence, we propose a joint model of trivariate longitudinal outcomes motivated by the Hypertension cohort study using Bayesian statistical inference for parameters estimation.
Objectives
The objectives of this study are to examine the joint models and association of three different types of longitudinal outcomes of hypertensive patients and identify possible risk factors of the trivariate variables.
Methods 
In this study, 376 hypertensive patients with age greater than 18 years, were on treatment and measured at least three times were included to investigate the comparison between the separate and joint models using linear mixed model. In order to avoid the challenge of complexity and high-dimensional integration problem, we consider sampling methods for Bayesian inference for the joint model. We use deviance information criterion (DIC) that were obtained from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to select the best model and evaluate the proposed model performance via simulations and apply it to a data set to assess the association between longitudinal Continuous (BMI), binary (depression), and ordinal (stress interference) outcomes and time to heart attack.
Results 
Age variable seems to be insignificant in the separate approach, but significant in the joint approach, patients aged 50 years and above were found to have a slight decrease BMI values with age, but they may experience severe hypertension as they grow older. Patients with once/twice a week alcohol consumption are less likely to depress and less likely to experience severe hypertension. Result also shows that male patients significantly have a higher risk of heart attack from stress interference than female patients.
Conclusions 
From the results, it is suggested that the joint model was better in estimating trivariate longitudinal outcomes compare to separate model. Also, show a strong association among the three longitudinal outcomes.
