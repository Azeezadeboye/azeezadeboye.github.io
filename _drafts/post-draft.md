In January 2021 I started my YouTube channel focusing purely on R. 
As a first project I decided to record myself solving the exercises in the R for Data Science book by Hadley Wickham. 
The result is the R for Data Science Exercise Walkthough Series.

Below youâ€™ll find the first few videos of the series. Make sure to subscribe to the channel to never miss a new video.
